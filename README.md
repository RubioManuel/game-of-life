<h1>Welcome to Game of Life! <img src="https://images.emojiterra.com/google/noto-emoji/unicode-15/animated/1f44b.gif", alt="Waving Hand Emoji" width=27></h1>

The **game of life** is a cellular automaton divised by the British mathematician John H. Conway in 1970. It's a zero player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. We interact with the game of life by creating an initial configuration and then observing how it evolves.

It is algo *Turing Complete*, meaning that it can simulate any turing machine.
